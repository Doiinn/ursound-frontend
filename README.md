# Ursound

> This is the senoir project in my university life. Actually, this is the last project while i am studying in university.This project is about tool to create a song. just like garage band which is favorite one but, unlike garage band. our project (I do this with my friend) is more helpful than garage band a little bit. It provides collaboration systems to user to creating a song together with their friends. That's all. I have nothing to say anymore. :P
